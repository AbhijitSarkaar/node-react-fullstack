Session based authentication flow 
- User signs up using google oauth flow 
- Google provides a unique identifier to application
- application creates a record for the user and stores the unique identifier provided by google in it’s record 
- Application returns a cookie to client for further authentication 
- User logs out. server removes the cookie and will not identify the user with the same cookie again 
- User signs in with google oauth flow and application identifies the user and sends a cookie back and the flow continues 


Getting users details from google oauth flow 
- Request to ‘/auth/google’, google sign in initiated where user provides permission to access google profile 
- Google redirects to server at ‘/auth/callback/google’ where it provides the ‘code’ value
- Passport makes request to google again with the received code after which it receives the user’s google account details 
- Passport then calls the callback function attached to it during google strategy initialisation. This callback function contains the users’s profile details 
- OAuth flow is used to provide a unique identifier to a user to a application 


Creating a new user record from google sign in flow 
- A new user record is created in the database from the google strategy callback function once verified that the user is a new user
