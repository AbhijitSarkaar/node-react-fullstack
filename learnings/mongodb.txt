notes 

    - max size of a document is 4 mb 
    - collections can be individual level or at a document level calling it subdocument level collections
    - queries
        - queries should return as less data as possible
        - for searching and filtering records, it is better to do it through database queries rather than pulling data into server 
        and doing the required computations
