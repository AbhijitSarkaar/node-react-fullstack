    - email sending flow 
        - list of recipients => 1 mailer object representing 1 email => email provider => emails sent to recipients 
            - only 1 email template is sent to all the recipients, i.e all recipients receive same email with same email body contents 

    - clicktracking / clicking links in a email body 
        - sendgrid replaces links in email body with links to their own servers, primarily to check which links are clicked 
        - sendgrid when replacing the links, adds a unique token to the link which identifies a user
        - from the sendgrid servers the links are then redirected to backend endpoints
